            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups old fashioned oats</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all purpose flower</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (at room temperature)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup peanutbutter (my preference is crunchy but if you're lame you can use smooth)</li>
                <li>1/2 granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two large baking sheet with Silpat baking mats or parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Using a mixer, beat the butter, peanut butter, and sugars together until creamy, this will take about 2 minutes, on medium speed. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>On low, add in the dry ingredients and mix until just until the combined.</li>
                <li>Scoop the cookies into round balls and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2 inches in between cookies. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly browned around the edges, but still soft in the middle.</li>
                <li>Remove cookies from oven and let cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
