        <h1>Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Honey and Miso</h1>
        <img src="../images/brusspic.jpg" alt="Lovely looking brussles sit perfectly roasted on a bed of almonds">
        
            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Brussels sprouts roasted simply with oil, salt and pepper are absolutely delicious â€” but if you want something a little more interesting, add a spoonful of red miso, a powerhouse of salt and umami.</p>
                <p>Pair it with sweet honey to balance out the earthy bitterness of the brussels sprouts. A hit of lime juice after roasting perks everything up, and chopped almonds add a nice crunch. You can double or triple this recipe to feed a large crowd, or to ensure that there are leftovers</p>
    
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon red miso paste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon red miso paste</li>
                    <li>1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise</li>
                    <li>1 line, halved</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chopped almonds</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, honey, miso and salt until smooth. Add the brussels sprouts and toss until evenly coated. Transfer the brussels sprouts to a rimmed baking sheet. Spread out in an even layer and scrape every last drop of the honey-miso mixture from the bowl on top.</li>
                    <li>Roast the brussels sprouts until tender and nicely caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway through with a spatula. Squeeze the lime juice over top, give the mixture a good toss and transfer to a serving dish. Sprinkle with the almonds, then serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
                </ol>
