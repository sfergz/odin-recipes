        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>If you keep canned beans, tomatoes, onion and garlic in your pantry, you can make this dish on any weeknight without having to shop. The pickled onions aren’t strictly necessary, but they are simple to make and add a welcome tangy contrast to the beans. Pickled peppers are a fine substitute.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the pickled onions: Squeeze lime juice into a bowl, and add onion, salt and sugar. Let rest while you make the chili.</li>
                <li>Prepare the chili: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add the oil. When hot, add onion and sauté until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, chile powder and oregano and sauté until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add beans and tomatoes and a few large pinches of salt and let simmer until the tomatoes break down, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Taste and add more salt, chile powder and/or oregano to taste. Serve with the pickled onions and any of the garnishes you like.</li>
            </ol>
